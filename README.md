This is an altered version of yolov5 that runs an extra classifier layer, but using a custom crop function as the natively implemented one leaves much to be desired. It is meant to run over a specific dataset with a specific set of weigths, but you may modify it as you wish.

Some python environments might return serialization errors when loading the weights. This is due to how github manages big files, introducing pointers that may render the object non-serializable. Unfortunately, there is no easy way around this. If you find this error and need the .pt files, contact me at jmargumanez@gmail.com and I'll be happy to forward them to you
